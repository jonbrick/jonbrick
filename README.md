### [calendar-workout-sync](https://github.com/jonbrick/calendar-workouts-sync)

This Node.js automation system fetches Strava workouts via OAuth, stores comprehensive fitness data in Notion databases with week-based processing, and creates rich Google Calendar events with workout details like duration, distance, and activity type, enabling visual fitness tracking through a two-script pipeline that transforms raw workout data into organized calendar scheduling.

### [recharts-demo](https://github.com/jonbrick/recharts-demo)

This Next.js dashboard builder demo visualizes engineering metrics from GitHub PRs, PagerDuty incidents, and GitHub Actions with three interactive cards (metrics, charts, tables), overlay comparisons, and real-time URL state synchronization for instant sharing of any dashboard configuration.

### [notion-task-maker](https://github.com/jonbrick/notion-task-maker)

This Node.js automation tool scans Apple Notes for notes titled "#Work" or "#Personal", extracts all text lines as tasks, uses Claude AI to categorize them into health/work/personal types, creates organized Notion database entries, and cleans up the original notes while preserving comments.

### [notion-week-summarizer](https://github.com/jonbrick/notion-week-summarizer)

This Node.js automation script connects to Notion and Claude AI to automatically generate concise weekly summaries of completed tasks by category, turning your task lists into professional recap content for retrospectives.

### [figma-text-styles-mapper](https://github.com/jonbrick/figma-text-styles-mapper)

This Figma plugin parses CSS code with Tailwind @apply directives to extract and display which Tailwind utility classes are used by each CSS selector, providing structured JSON output for design system analysis.

### [figma-variables-mapper](https://github.com/jonbrick/figma-variables-mapper)

This Figma plugin automates the creation of theme variables by parsing CSS @theme files and mapping them to existing design tokens with library references, supporting light/dark modes, sentiment-based variable lifecycle management, and performance optimization for large collections.

### [figma-collection-variable-key-extractor](https://github.com/jonbrick/figma-collection-variable-key-extractor)

This Figma plugin extracts variable keys from any local or library collection and exports them as JSON mappings (variable-name â†’ key), enabling other tools to programmatically import Figma variables using their unique keys.

### [figma-variable-keys-to-json](https://github.com/jonbrick/figma-variable-keys-to-json)

This Figma plugin exports variable data from local collections as downloadable JSON files, providing variable names, keys, IDs, and types in a structured format for use in external tools or documentation workflows.

### [figma-opacity-variables-used-to-json](https://github.com/jonbrick/figma-opacity-variables-used-to-json)

This Figma plugin audits and manages opacity variables with underscore syntax (like red/25_90) by comparing source and target collections to identify unused variables for removal, while also converting CSS theme variables into properly organized Figma variables with cross-collection alias support and automated light/dark mode mapping.

### [figma-oklch-variable-generator](https://github.com/jonbrick/figma-oklch-variable-generator)

This Figma plugin automatically converts Tailwind CSS color variables using OKLCH color space (like --color-red-500: oklch(0.627 0.258 29.23)) into properly organized Figma color variables with accurate RGB conversion, enabling seamless design token synchronization between modern CSS systems and Figma design workflows.

### [figma-brand-palette-generator](https://github.com/jonbrick/figma-brand-palette-generator)

This Figma plugin generates a complete 9-shade color palette (100-900) from a single brand color input and creates organized variables in local collections, enabling designers to quickly establish consistent color systems with automatic lightness and saturation adjustments across the entire palette.

### [figma-alias-console-logger](https://github.com/jonbrick/figma-alias-console-logger)

This Figma debugging plugin analyzes and logs the internal structure of variable alias relationships across local and library collections, helping developers understand the exact format requirements for creating cross-collection variable references in the Figma API.

### [chrome-token-transfer-plugin](https://github.com/jonbrick/chuprome-token-transfer-plugin)

This Chrome extension streamlines local development workflow by automatically copying authentication cookies (SESSION and XSRF-TOKEN) from the Cortex staging API environment to the local development server, eliminating the need for manual authentication set.

### [shadcn-dashboard-exploration](https://github.com/jonbrick/shadcn-dashboard-exploration)

This exploration project is a proof-of-concept Next.js application exploring drag-and-drop functionality for re-orderable dashboard cards using @dnd-kit libraries and shadcn/ui components, demonstrated through a banking application interface.
